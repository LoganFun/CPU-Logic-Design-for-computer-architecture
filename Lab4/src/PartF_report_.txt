Writing with VIM

Dynamic Logic:

1. Record each core hit and miss history

2. Don't use the default num of ways, declare one by you self in cache.cpp

3. Also Empty First

4. Based on the hit history of each core, change the num of ways.

5. if (num_Hit_core0 > 1.1*num_Hit_core1 && num_Hit_core0 < 1.2*num_Hit_core1): slightly increase num_ways_core0. Next, if num_Hit_core0 >= 1.2*num_Hit_core1 &&num_Hit_core0 < 1.3*num_Hit_core1 increase num_ways_case0 larger than first case. 

6. Inverse, hit_core0 < C * hit_core1, decrease the num_ways_core0 step by step.
